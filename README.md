# Building-on-Avalanche---ETH-AVAX

The DegenToken Smart Contract is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, designed to be deployed on the Avalanche Fuji testnet. It implements an ERC-20 token with added functionalities, such as minting, transferring, and burning tokens, as well as an in-game store where tokens can be redeemed for items.

#  Feature 

1.  Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
2.  Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
3.  Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
4.  Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
5.  Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.
